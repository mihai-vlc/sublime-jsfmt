### Formatting rules

You can set global rules via a `.jsfmtrc`. Be crazy and establish one for all your 
projects in `~/.jsfmtrc`. (like in [dotfiles](https://github.com/paulirish/dotfiles/blob/master/.jsfmtrc))

Otherwise you're probably pretty levelheaded and will probably provide one in your 
project root. It'll be read and applied.

Rules you can intuit from these [esformatter preset files](https://github.com/millermedeiros/esformatter/tree/master/lib/preset).

There's a `.jsfmtrc-sample` in this repo. It's a good start. Rename it and toss it 
somewhere. Try it out. 

### Installing plugins
If you want to use a plugin that is not installed by default you will need to follow the next steps:

1. Go to the packages folder (Preferences -> Browse Packages)  
2. cd into the jsfmt folder.  
3. Install the plugins you need.  
4. Go to your jsfmt settings file and add the name of the plugin in the plugins array.  

#### Compatibility 

Should work in both ST2 and ST3.
