> esformatter plugin: always put a space after a !

**Esformatter-special-bangs* is a plugin for [esformatter](https://github.com/millermedeiros/esformatter) that does a very simple thing: it inserts a space after a ! in the code.

This is because our coding standard requires a space after !, but not after any other unary operator.
